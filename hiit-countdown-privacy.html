        <p>
          This privacy policy describes how HIIT Countdown collects and uses
          data from users of our iPhone app. We respect your privacy and are
          committed to protecting your personal information. This policy
          explains how we use and safeguard any data that we collect from you
          when you use our app.
        </p>
        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>
          We do not collect any user data from our iPhone app, except for data
          that is necessary to display ads from AdMob. AdMob may collect certain
          data from your device, such as your device ID, IP address, and
          location information, to deliver personalized ads. This data is
          collected and used in accordance with AdMob's privacy policy, which
          can be found at https://policies.google.com/privacy.
        </p>

        <h2>Use of Data</h2>

        <p>
          We do not use any user data that we collect for any purposes. The only
          data that we collect is used by AdMob to display personalized ads to
          you.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>

        <p>
          We do not share any user data that we collect with any third parties,
          except for AdMob, which may use the data to deliver personalized ads.
        </p>

        <h2>Security</h2>

        <p>
          We take reasonable steps to protect the data that we collect from you.
          However, no data transmission over the internet is completely secure,
          so we cannot guarantee the security of your data.
        </p>

        <h2>Updates to this Policy</h2>

        <p>
          We may update this privacy policy from time to time by posting a new
          version on our website. You should check this page occasionally to
