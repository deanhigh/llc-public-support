        <p>
          This privacy policy describes how HIIT Countdown collects and uses
          data from users of our iPhone app. We respect your privacy and are
          committed to protecting your personal information. This policy
          explains how we use and safeguard any data that we collect from you
          when you use our app.
        </p>
        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
          We do not collect any personal information from users of HIIT
          Countdown. However, our app does include AdMob ads and Google
          Analytics, which may collect certain non-personal information, such as
          device type, operating system, and app usage data. This information is
          collected solely for the purpose of providing targeted advertising and
          improving our app's functionality.
        </p>
    
        <h3>AdMob Ads</h3>
        <p>
          Our app includes AdMob ads, which are provided by Google. AdMob may
          use certain data, such as device type and app usage data, to provide
          targeted advertising. For more information on AdMob's privacy policy,
          please visit their website at
          <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy"
            >https://policies.google.com/privacy</a
          >.
        </p>

        <h3>Google Analytics</h3>
        <p>
          Our app also uses Google Analytics to track usage data and app
          performance. This information is collected anonymously and is used
          solely to improve our app's functionality. For more information on
          Google Analytics' privacy policy, please visit their website at
          <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy"
            >https://policies.google.com/privacy</a
          >.
        </p>

        <h2>Use of Data</h2>

        <p>
          We do not use any user data that we collect for any purposes. The only
          data that we collect is used by AdMob to display personalized ads to
          you.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>

        <p>
          We do not share any user data that we collect with any third parties,
          except for AdMob, which may use the data to deliver personalized ads.
        </p>

        <h2>Security</h2>

        <p>
          We take reasonable steps to protect the data that we collect from you.
          However, no data transmission over the internet is completely secure,
          so we cannot guarantee the security of your data.
        </p>

        <h2>Updates to this Policy</h2>

        <p>
          We may update this privacy policy from time to time by posting a new
          version on our website. You should check this page occasionally to
          ensure that you are happy with any changes.
